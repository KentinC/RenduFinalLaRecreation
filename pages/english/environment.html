          <h2>The hour of Recreation rang!</h2>
          <p>
            An exotic restaurant, completely atypical in a former school between the wars invites you to discover its cuisine in the small village "Les Arques". Classroom, playground with courtyard have been transformed into a lush garden, where one lunch under the chestnut tree or under the mulberry trees. In the evening, the lighting emphasizes the ancient stone walls of this idyllic and historic place where artists come to exhibit. An inventive cuisine in the spirit of the site, rich in flavors and surprises from all over the world, guaranteeing fresh vegetables from the vegetable garden adjoining the restaurant.
            <br/> The restaurant organizes regular cooking classes and develops a catering service at home.
            <br/>
            <br/> More than a good restaurant, it's a trip.

            <br/>
            <br/> The restaurant is located in the town of Les Arques, a small village located in the south of France in the region "Midi Pyrenees" and more precisely in the department of Lot. This village is 26 km from Cahors and 26 km from Gourdon. To the south of the Périgord and to the south-east of the Dordogne, the village is classified for the Saint Laurent church, the frescoes of Saint Andrée, the old doyenneté and its tower. Les Arques is also known for its museum devoted to Ossip Zadkine, the workshops of Les Arques bringing each year a dozen artists from all over Europe, and of course the restaurant La Récréation. What an excitement in such a small village of 217 inhabitants.

            <h2>THE ZADKINE MUSEUM</h2>
            <p>Les Arques is a small village located in the lot.
              <br/>
              <br/>In the eleventh century a settlement was established on the ridge around a Priory and in the valley a series of buildings dedicated to craft activities.
              <br/> Of all this, there remains a very diverse architectural heritage such as the Romanesque church, mills, pigeon houses, ovens and other chapels.
              <br/> In the 1930s, the village attracted a great sculptor, Zadkine, whose 26-year-old museum has perpetuated the memory. The Zadkine Museum was conceived as a center of cultural life. It is in this village that are presented prestigious documents and works that testify to the creation of the artist: Great woods, powerful bronzes, engravings, photos. Five large sculptures animate the village.</p>

            <h2>THE VALLEY OF THE MASS AND THE MARK OF THE ARKS</h2>
            <p>
              The development of an area known as "Sensitive Natural Area" offers a visit to the wetlands of the village and the marking of various hiking trails.
              <br/> This area benefits from a management and development program carried out by the General Council of Lot, in partnership with local authorities and various stakeholders (owners, farmers, hunters, hikers, etc.).
              <br/>
              <br/> Its cultural and historical heritage of great interest (mills of the Masse, medieval ironwork, chapel Saint-André, ...) continues to attract a large number of tourists.
              <br/> To discover this wetland, a 4.5 km interpretation circuit was built partly on grating. This circuit starting from the village of Arques, is equipped with terminals implanted along the route. By slipping the cards of the guide discovered, these terminals turn into orientation table and allow to understand the specificities of the spaces available to hikers. The Frescoes of Saint Andrew, the building could be dated to the 11th century according to the plan, construction techniques and paintings end of the 15th century.
